Definition Loading Process
------------------------------------------------------------

1. The ResourceManager is pointed to a directory and loads each file in it using fs
2. The files are turned into strings and parsed using eval()
3. The ResourceManager emits a "definitionLoaded" event, which the DefinitionManager listens for
4. This event includes the evaled definition w/ the raw string version also attached as a reference
5. The raw definition is evaled again at the node level
