FIX:
    > Refactor BaseNode Class and it's descendants:
        - Simplify arguments (just MidiPlex and an options object)
        - Add meta object which contains ANY data that the UI might need to know or assign so that it doesn't have to directly access or modify the node
        - Remove EventBridge for the time being until this feature is better understood
        - Consider spreading any required systems from MidiPlex to the scene object and passing that down to 
            node sub-systems (events-bridge, etc.) instead of passing down midiplex
        - The defined node sandbox

    > Refactor the way nodes are created:
        - The scene should handle creation of nodes rather than the parsing function since we have to do this dynamically anyways

    > Refactor the definitions to use the globally exposed variables rather than parameters


FEATURES:
    MidiPlex Renderer 
        Events:
            interpolateProperty

            MessageGroup
                > defines a set of messages which should all be sent at (virtually) the same time
                > the actual order depends on the type of message, and will probably be something like this:
                    1. controlchange
                    2. noteon
                    3. noteoff
                    4. ...?

            MessageRoll
                > essentially an array of MessageGroups
                > 

            Sequence
                > _index = the current spot in the MessageRoll
                > _roll = MessageRoll
                > next() = increment the index, return the current MessageGroup
